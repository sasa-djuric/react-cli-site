# Getting started

<Description>A quick tutorial to get you up and running with React CLI.</Description>

### 1. Install the React CLI

Install React CLI from your command line.

```bash
npm install -g cr-react-cli
```

### 2. Init configuration

To setup React CLI by your preferences, run the init command to generate a config file.

```bash
npx react init
```

After the init command is executed, you will be asked questions about your preferences. After you answer all questions, in case that you choose the project scope for the config file, the react.config.json file will be generated at the root of your project.

### 3. Use it

React CLI can be used with several aliases like: cr-react-cli, react-cli, react, rct.
Run component, context or hook commands to generate boilerplate files.

```bash
npx react component menu
npx react context menu
npx react hook useMenu
```
